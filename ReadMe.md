# HomeBrew RPG

This project aims to provide a platform for character creation and management that players and game masters within the a homebrew DnD system can use. The goal is to help to streamline and improve the experience of players and game masters alike.

## Installation

This program can be downloaded using the clone or download zip options from the main repo page. The program was written in Visual Studio 2019 Community, and I would recommend using VS to run the project.

## Usage

When the project is downloaded and opened you should be able to simply run it and be good to go. Startup should be set to HomeBrewRPG.WebMVC

## Azure

## Down the road
I plan to continue working on improvements for this application. Some major things that likely need implemented:

* Partial views to create the character sheet for scalability
* Edit partial views for more seamless in game changes

### Nice to implement features I may look to move into:
* Campaigns players can join
* User roles (including a game master view)
* An item shop
